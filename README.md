## Introduction

### AI Engineering

**AI Engineering** is the process of designing and implementing AI systems using pre-trained models and existing AI tools to solve practical problems. They work to ensure AI systems are efficient, scalable, distinguishing their role from AI Researchers and ML Engineers, who concentrate more on creating new models or advancing AI theory.

## Common Terminology

### AGI vs AI

### Inference

In AI, inference refers to the process where a trained ML model makes predictions or draws conclusions from new, unseen data. Unlike training, inference involves the model applying what it has learned to make decisions without needing examples of the exact result. In essence, inference is the AI model actively functioning. For example, a self-driving car recognizing a stop sign on a road it has never encountered before demonstrates inference. The model identifies the stop sign in a new setting, using its learned knowledge to make a decision in real-time.
